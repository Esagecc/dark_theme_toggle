I completed this exercise for the Weekly Web Dev Challenge of Scrimba.

The challenge was to make a dark and light theme toggle switch for this exercise. 

I wanted a toggle with sun and moon icons, I went to Youtube and look for the video with that features. https://youtu.be/xodD0nw2veQ It was a great video with simple instruction.

The challenges I had to overcome is figuering out how to use Font Awesome. I thought I had the correct script code for my account but I had go back to my Font Awesome account and get the right script code. I also had trouble figuering out how to CSS figure to add color once the checkbox is checked. I reviewed my test many times again and again. I missed type checkbox for checkbook. 

I started this project on 11/21/2021 night and I completed it on 11/22/2021.
